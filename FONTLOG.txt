FONTLOG for the Elstob fonts

Elstob is a variable font intended to support medievalists working with European languages
that use the Latin script, but the character set is also complete for all modern European
languages using the Latin script. It is intended to contain all Unicode characters commonly
used by medievalists. In addition, it includes the complete Unicode Runic range and all
characters used in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

The variable font includes Weight, Optical Size and Grade axes. For details, see the "Features
and Character Set" document.

The model for this font is the Double Pica commissioned by Bishop John Fell, cut by the Dutch
designer Peter De Walpergen, and used by the Oxford University Press in the late seventeenth
and early eighteenth centuries. Wherever possible, it is based on a specimen printed in 1925
with type cast in the 1890s from the seventeenth-century matrices.
