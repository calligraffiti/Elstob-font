# Elstob-font
The Elstob font (named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Saxonist Elizabeth Elstob) is based on the developer's own Junicode font--a standard among medievalists. Unlike Junicode, Elstob is designed as a webfont. Thus:
1. It is a variable font, with weights ranging from Light to Bold.
2. Outlines have been radically simplified, significantly reducing file size.
3. The original source for the font (George Hickes, Thesaurus, Oxford, 1703-1705) has been revisited and the letter-forms improved.
4. The italic has been extensively redesigned in a more modern upright style.
5. The character set has been reduced to 503 glyphs, concentrating on those most useful for representing Old and Middle English, Old Norse, and Latin medieval texts. Many other characters from the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, present in Junicode, can be represented with combining diacritics.
