# Elstob-font
The Elstob font (named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Saxonist Elizabeth Elstob) is based on the Double Pica commissioned by Bishop John Fell in the seventeenth century. Elstob is designed as a webfont. Thus:
1. It is a variable font, with weights ranging from ExtraLight to ExtraBold, optical sizes from "Fine Print" (circa 6 points) to "Display" (circa 18 points or greater) and also a grade axis (1-500). (A non-variable desktop version will also be available.)
2. Outlines have been kept simple to limit file size.
4. The intention of the font is to include everything in Unicode useful to a substantial number of medievalists, but the character set has been limited to around 1000 glyphs to keep file size reasonable. Many characters from the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, present in the designer's Junicode font, can be represented with combining diacritics.
