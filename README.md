# Elstob-font
The Elstob font (named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Saxonist Elizabeth Elstob) is based on the Double Pica commissioned by Bishop John Fell in the seventeenth century. Elstob is designed as a webfont. Thus:
1. It is a variable font, with weights ranging from Light to ExtraBold and optical sizes from "Fine Print" to "Display."
2. The roman face also has a Grade axis, and the italic has Slant.
3. Outlines have been kept simple to limit file size.
4. The intention of the font is to contain everything in Unicode useful to a substantial number of medievalists, but the character set has been limited to under 800 glyphs so as to keep file size reasonable. Many characters from the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, present in the designer's Junicode font, can be represented with combining diacritics.
